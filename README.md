## FAQ

#### Why do we we use HTML?

- HTML guarantees that text and pictures are properly formatted for your Internet browser. 
- A browser would not be able to display text as elements or load pictures or other components if HTML was not present. 
- _It defines the page's basic skeleton._

#### What is a Tag in HTML?

- Tags are used in HTML pages to put information and format pages.
- These are defined between (<) and (>) symbols. 
- For example, [h1 tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp).

#### What are Attributes in HTML?

- Attributes are special words that are used inside the opening tag to influence the behaviour of the element.
- For example, A hyperlink is defined by the [anchor tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp). The href attribute gives the URL of the page to which the link goes.
